# Twitter Clone

Developed a dynamic and responsive Twitter clone web application that replicates core features of Twitter, including tweet creation, real-time updates, user profiles, and media sharing. The application integrates Firebase for authentication, Firestore for database management, and Firebase Storage for media storage, providing a seamless and scalable solution for user interaction.

# Key Features:

User Authentication: Implemented Firebase Authentication for secure and efficient user login and registration.
Real-Time Data: Utilized Firestore's real-time capabilities to ensure instant updates across the app.
Media Uploads: Integrated Firebase Storage for efficient image upload and management.
Responsive UI: Designed an intuitive, mobile-friendly interface using React and Tailwind CSS for optimal user experience.
This project highlights my expertise in full-stack development, Firebase integration, and building scalable web applications.
